# Airbnb Bangkok Accommodation Preference Analysis

## Background

Airbnb is an online platform that allows individuals or property owners to rent accommodations such as houses, apartments, villas, rooms, or other lodging options to guests seeking a place to stay. Airbnb enables property owners to advertise their spaces, set rental prices, and provide descriptions, photos, and information about the amenities they offer. Guests looking for accommodations can browse various property listings on Airbnb, view details, read reviews from previous guests, and make reservations online. Airbnb has grown rapidly since its inception and is now available in many countries around the world, including Bangkok, Thailand.

In this project, I assume the role of a data analyst at Airbnb, responsible for analyzing data to provide insights and recommendations to property owners who advertise on Airbnb. The analysis focuses on guest preferences when choosing rental accommodations in Bangkok based on the popularity of accommodations, represented by the number of guest reviews. It is widely recognized that products with "high prices and high reviews" are more trusted by consumers than products with "low prices and low reviews" (Jaikumar, 2019). A high number of reviews can be considered a social proof that a product or service is popular and in demand, influencing purchase decisions by enhancing the perceived value and popularity of the product or service. A high number of reviews also instills confidence in potential customers, as they tend to feel more assured when there are numerous reviews from previous customers, indicating reliability and quality. The results of this analysis, when shared with property owners, are expected to help formulate business strategies for property rentals based on guest preferences, ultimately leading to increased transactions on Airbnb and higher revenue.

## Problem Statement

Airbnb aims to increase the number of transactions on its platform by influencing property owners in Bangkok who advertise on Airbnb to design rental property business strategies tailored to guest preferences. Guest preferences can be assessed through indicators such as the number of reviews, which significantly influence potential guests' decisions to make bookings.

To achieve this goal, as a data analyst at Airbnb, I will attempt to answer the following question:

**What are the characteristics of accommodation rentals in Bangkok listed on Airbnb that align with guest preferences when making rental decisions?**

## Conclusion

The conclusions drawn from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the 'Airbnb Listings Bangkok' dataset are as follows:

1. Vadhana, Khlong Toei, Huai Khwang, Ratchathewi, and Bang Rak are the top five locations with the highest number of accommodation rentals, accounting for 46.32% of all available accommodations in Bangkok. In terms of popularity, Khlong Toei, Vadhana, and Ratchathewi have received the highest number of reviews (in the last year) in descending order with 13,502, 9,671, and 4,426 reviews, respectively.
2. The most commonly offered room type in the top three popular locations is 'entire home/apt,' accounting for 66.52% of all room types. The order of room types with the highest number of reviews in these top locations is 'entire home/apt,' 'private room,' 'hotel,' and 'shared room.'
3. The most frequently offered minimum stay policy in the top three popular locations is 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days. In terms of room types, the 1-night minimum stay policy has the most reviews (2,429 reviews) and is offered the most (47.87% of all rooms). The 7-day and 30-day minimum stay policies are only available for entire home/apt and private room types.
4. Examining pricing, the 'entire home/apt' room type has the highest number of reviews in the range of 2,050.2-3,000.0 baht. The 'private room' type has the highest number of reviews in the range of 499.999-950.0 baht. The 'hotel' type has the highest number of reviews in the range of 1,497.0-1,990.0 baht. The 'shared room' type has the highest number of reviews in the range of 499.999-506.25 baht.
5. Four out of the top five property owners (top 5% based on the number of reviews) with the highest potential profits in the popular locations offer only 'entire home/apt' room types, while one owner offers 'entire home/apt' for 87.10% of all rooms they provide.

## Recommendations

Based on the conclusions above, here are some recommendations for property owners who are or will be advertising on Airbnb:

1. In terms of popularity based on the number of reviews, property owners are recommended to offer accommodation rentals in the Khlong Toei, Vadhana, and Ratchathewi areas. These three areas are centrally located in Bangkok with good accessibility to various parts of the city. They are served by efficient transportation systems, including subway (MRT) stations and major road networks. The presence of convenient and accessible transportation makes these areas attractive to tourists and visitors who want to explore the city easily. Furthermore, these areas each have their own unique attractions for tourists and visitors. Therefore, offering accommodation rentals in these areas is a sound decision.

2. 'Entire home/apt' room types significantly outperform other room types in terms of popularity based on the number of reviews. Property owners are advised to prioritize offering 'entire home/apt' room types. 'Shared room' types are considerably less popular compared to other room types, likely due to the preference of most guests for not sharing a room with others, making it less recommended for property owners to offer this room type.

3. Property owners are encouraged to set a minimum stay policy of 1 night. For 'entire home/apt' and 'private room' types, which are suitable for longer stays, providing options for monthly rentals with special pricing can attract guests seeking extended accommodations.

4. To maximize the potential for guests to choose their rental listings, property owners are recommended to price their accommodations within the popular price ranges for each room type, as detailed in the conclusions. Room facilities should be aligned with the offered prices to remain competitive and attractive compared to competitors.

5. Reflecting on property owners who receive a high number of reviews and have the potential for high profits, property owners or investors with a higher budget are advised to focus on offering 'entire home/apt' room types to maximize potential profits.

This project provides valuable insights for property owners looking to optimize their listings on Airbnb and enhance their profitability by aligning their offerings with guest preferences in Bangkok.
